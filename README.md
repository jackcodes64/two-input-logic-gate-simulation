# two-input-logic-gate-simulation
Simple C++ logic gates simulations
Supports:
  1. AND gate
  2. OR gate
  3. NAND gate
  4. NOR gate
  5. XOR gate
  6. XNOR gate

It is important to note that the implementation only take two binary variables per logic gate. 
And NOT gate was omitted for its directness.
